All running services are managed by supervisord. You can use supervisorctl to start and stop them.

Some useful commands:

  - 'logtail.sh' will print live logs for all processes.
  
  - 'supervisorctl stop horde-dreamer' will stop the dreamer(s). Use this if you prefer to start and manage the dreamer manually.
  

You have been logged in to the 'dreamer' environment via micromamba.
